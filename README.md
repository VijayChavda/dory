#### Some introduction which you may skip...
All the digital data that you create like images and videos taken from your phone camera, songs, videos or software that you download, your work related documents, spreadsheets or slides, everything take form of files, and all these files reside in some directories ("folders" if you are a Windows person). A directory can contain many files and directories, which may further contain more files and directories. This form of hierarchical structure is a great way to organize your files, but it has it's own limitation:

> If you use directories as a way to "categorise" your files, sometimes you just can't decide in which directory a file should go, maybe because it makes sense for that file to have multiple categories. But a single instance of file cannot exist in multiple directories!

#### Enter Dory :D
Dory is a file explorer which lets you "tag" your files. With many-to-many relation between files and tags, it is the perfect way to organize your data.
